I created small applications for an agency, including a VueJS web app for Virgin. This app featured animations and integration with an existing microphone recording/analyzing library (no longer connected). Similarly, I developed another VueJS app for British Paint. <br/> <br/> I also participated in creating an analytics product for Nintex, heavily centered on statistical data and charts.<br/><br/> Tools employed: ReactJS, VueJS, Angular 8+, Sass, OpenLayers, REST API, Chart.js, Storybook",
