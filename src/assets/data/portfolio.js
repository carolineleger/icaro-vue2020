      "Tasks: In 2023, I worked on the rebranding of a Shopify website (Wilde) using their headless platform (Hydrogen) and ReactJS, heavily focused on animations. I also worked on delivering front end pages for a Streaming/NFT website (Rad), with a strong focus on reusable components, considering the depth of the website. You can also find a simple landing page for a managing app (Gestaltra) built in VueJS. Before, I also worked on multiple wordpress websites including Intelematics (Wordpress, full rebranding using html/sass and js, and very basic php tweaks)<br/> <br/>Example: Wilde",

The last one I worked on (from scratch, still not release), had similar functionnalities as Carsales.com. I also built small apps for an agency, one of them is a web app for Virgin using VueJS. It involved animations and connecting to an existing microphone recording/analyzing library(now disconnected).
